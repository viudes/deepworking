# Deepworking project

Created for monitoring activities done for projects I have been working on. The main idea is to know what type of activities are related to some project such as writing a blog post, writing an article for a given magazine or even writing a book. Besides to know the actitivites related I would like to know which time might be better for working? Should I start working at my project at 5 AM? Or might be better later? But how do you define a better time to work one should ask me. To be the better time to focus deeply in some activity or project, it should be one without interruptions, with silence and a comfortable place with everything I need to work.

## Why not to use an excel stylesheet

This project is also a little lab for testing technologies I am interested in. If you find it interesting and want to help improving, just send a pull request.

### Notes

I do not know a better approach to score the focusing times of work, so I am just using a simple measure regarding GOOD, REGULAR and BAD using just fixed values for each one.
